**Title: Budget Time!**

Welcome to the start of your financial freedom. **Why Is a Budget Important? A budget** **helps create financial stability**. By tracking expenses and following a plan, a budget makes it easier to pay bills on time, build an emergency fund, and save for major expenses such as a car or home.

Within this application, you will be able to do just that: easily create new budget months, as the year progresses, and input your expected income for that month.  Once created, you will be able to navigate to the given month and add transactions, either as they happen during the month OR just do them all at once in grouped categories at the end of the month.

The app will track and display the difference between your budget and your expenses, updating live as you input each transaction.
